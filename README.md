# NASA Images

In this project my task was to create a React front end app that presents the data from the free NASA astronomy image of the day API. I also have solved the project in pure javascript.

Every day there's a new image or video uploaded by NASA. You can also read a brief description below the image/video. On the landing page you'll see the current one, but you can simply choose any date from the past and the site will update itself.

## I have learned and furthered my knowledge in the following topics:

- Create a React app
- UseEffect and UseState in React
